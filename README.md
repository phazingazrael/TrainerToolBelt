# Trainer Tool Belt
This project originally began as a personal utility that I planned to use for streaming Pokemon Let's Plays because the thought of manually editing the team information into the video felt unneccesarry and editing in post is not my strong suit. 

After creating a rough proof of concept for the project I decided that it needed to be improved upon and took up the task of recreating it as a standalone desktop application without the need for a web host however this soon presented issues that would have rendered the project unusable. 

This project has received many revisions to its concept since it was first created, One such revision is that the project now runs on Node.js using React.js, Express.js and some other companion libraries to aid in development. The base of the project is stemmed from Kriasoft's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#readme).
